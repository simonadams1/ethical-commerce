# Ethical commerce

Buy from businesses that align with your values.

## Features

* Add causes you support or oppose to your account and see which businesses are closest or furthest from your values.
* Create lists of causes and share with others.
* Enter actions taken by businesses and link them to causes.
* Search product categories like shoes or computer keyboards and find companies that manufacture/sell it rated by the level of support or opposition to causes added in your account.

## How it works

The main data source for evaluating a businesses is a community managed database of actions taken by a businesses.

For example, Airbnb is running an "open homes" [program](https://web.archive.org/web/20190827212619/https://www.airbnb.com/openhomes/refugee-housing) to help provide housing for refugees.

After we have an action taken by a business in the database, we need to add categories for the action to be useful. We could say that the business offers indirect financial support to refugees in this case, and it is a supporting action towards refugees.

Now users can add "refugees" cause to their account and choose one of the following:
* support businesses that support refugees
* oppose businesses that support refugees
* support businesses that oppose refugees
* oppose businesses that oppose refugees

## Neutrality

Not everyone agrees even on the same events. What might be called a humanitarian intervention in a country by one group of people, could be viewed as occupation by another.

The platform allows users to create personal dictionaries that will overwrite the names of causes for their accounts. Dictionaries can also be shared.

## Decentralization and moderation

The platform is open source and decentralized. Anyone can create their own instance and synchronize the database of actions taken by businesses and causes with other instances. Every instance has their own administrators who make sure the data submitted by the community is accurate. Every instance can choose which other instances to synchronize with and whether to trust their moderators or to review the content before importing.

## Privacy

All user accounts are anonymous and no personal data is collected.
